# Birthday Counter App
## Summary
> This application asks for the user's birthday and calculates the days since.
### Outcome

## Concepts Used
- functions
- datetime module

## Resources
This game was based on a Birthday app listed as App 3 in the following course: <a href="https://github.com/mikeckennedy/python-jumpstart-course-demos" target="_blank">**Talk Python to Me - Building 10 Apps Course**</a>

## Ideas to Improve
- The user has to enter their year in the beginning. This is never used in the subsequent functions. Figure out a way to not require the user to enter this (will have to play with datetime).
- Figure out how to display both the days since and the days until the user's birthday.
